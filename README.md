## Calgary Drone Simulator

A drone simulator set in an accurate model of downtown Calgary built using real-world satellite data. Includes a mini-game in which you collect coins from 5 landmark locations.

This is not meant to be an accurate simulation, instead just a prototype to practice my skills and explore what can be done using satellite data.

## Credits
- I made the map from Google Maps 3D data using [MapsModelsImporter](https://github.com/eliemichel/MapsModelsImporter) by Elie Michel. 
- I used the drone model and physics scripts from [this tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vUyAev7YAV8&list=PL5V9qxkY_RnLyWVtxIbWY0ihiyOaAYoRr) by Indie-Pixel.
- Inspiration: [Geographical Adventures](https://github.com/SebLague/Geographical-Adventures) by Sebastian Lague.

## Future Plans
- Creating a larger and higher resolution 3D model of Calgary by stitching together multiple high-res models using [Lily Capture Merger](https://eliemichel.gumroad.com/l/KSvXuu)
- Minimap
- Settings menu so the user can modify certain variables (i.e throttle, horizontal speed)
- Adding visible mountains in the distance, and clouds
- More coins at landmark locations
- (possibly) creating a VR version of this project, or adding VR support
